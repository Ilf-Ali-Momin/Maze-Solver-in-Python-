# Maze-Solver-in-Python-
A Python-based maze solver using Depth-First Search (DFS). This project parses a maze from a text file, solves it, and visualizes the solution path with matplotlib, outputting the result as a PNG image. Great for learning algorithms, pathfinding, and visualization in Python.
